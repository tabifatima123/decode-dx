    <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Turrab  Fatima</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a 3rd semester Computer Science Engineering student in sejong university  passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. DecodeDx is a platform I built to make complex AI-based diagnostic research more accessible to students, researchers, and curious learners.

      This website summarizes cutting-edge research papers in medical imaging, bioinformatics, and explainable AI â€” especially focusing on breast cancer detection. It serves as my academic portfolio and a community resource.
